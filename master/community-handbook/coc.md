# Code of Conduct

We value the participation of every member of our community and want to ensure that every contributor has an enjoyable and fulfilling experience.
Accordingly, everyone who participates in the Turing Way project is expected to show respect and courtesy to other community members at all times.

Kirstie Whitaker, as PI of this project, and all project members, are dedicated to a ***harassment-free experience for everyone***, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. **We do not tolerate harassment by and/or of members of our community in any form**.

We are particularly motivated to support new and/or anxious collaborators, people who are looking to learn and develop their skills, and anyone who has experienced discrimination in the past.

To make clear what is expected, we ask all members of the community to conform to the following Code of Conduct.

The Code of Conduct document has been written in 4 parts: {ref}`Overview <ch-coc-overview>`, {ref}`Details <ch-coc-details>`, {ref}`Reporting <ch-coc-reporting>` and {ref}`Enforcement <ch-coc-enforcement>`.

The last part acknowledges all sources that this Code of Conduct has been built upon.
